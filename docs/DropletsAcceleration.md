# Droplets Acceleration

## About
This component applies forces like acceleration and gravity to the simulated rain.

## Parameters
- `Acceleration Scale` - acceleration is multiplied by this value. You can controll this way how much acceleration should impact the rain movement.
- `Add Velocity Factor` - adds car velocity in addition to the acceleration to the force acting on the rain drops (i.e., when car is not accelerating but going with a set speed the drops will be still affected like in real life by the air drag).
- `Gravity Force` - vector of gravity acting on the rain drops. You can add wind vector to it to simulate windy weather.
