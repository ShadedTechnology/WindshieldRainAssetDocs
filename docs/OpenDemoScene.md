# Opening Demo Scene

First we have to import assets from the package. Select `Common` folder, `Readme` files and folder with the name of the pipeline you use (`Built-in RP`, `URP` or `HDRP`). Make sure to uncheck folders for other pipelines.

Then navigate to directory "Assets/WindshieldRainAsset/&lt;YourPipeline&gt;/Demo/Scenes" and open "DemoScene" scene.<br/>
Next before you run the scene click first on the GameObject named "--- !!! OPEN ME FIRST !!! ---" in the scene hierarchy.

In the Inspector you should see something like this:

> <img src="_media/package_installer_inspector.png" alt="You should see this component" width="800" /><br/>
> You should see this component

If you have newer Unity Editor you will see that TextMeshPro is already installed because its now built into the Unity Editor.

Now install all missing packages by clicking on the buttons **one at a time!** This may take a while so you have to be patient.

If you are using URP Pipeline, you should see also warning to add renderer features. Click "Add Render Features" to enable widshield blur and glass rendering.

After installing all packages, the "PackageCheckerBehaviour" component should look like this:

> After installing all packages you should see this



Now you can start the Demo Scene!

Sometimes when starting the scene just after you've installed TextMeshPro Essentials the UI text doesn't load.
If your text is missing like below, stop and restart the game one more time.

> If you don't see UI text in your Demo Scene, stop and start the scene one more time.

Now everything should work. You can play around and test the Windshield Rain Asset!
