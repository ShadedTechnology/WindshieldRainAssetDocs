# Troubleshooting

## FAQ
### - My demo scene doesn't work correctly
Double-check that you followed the [Open Demo Scene](/OpenDemoScene) guide carefully, step by step. If something still is not working please contact me on email.
### - I tried changing Windshield Rain parameters via script or animation, but nothing happens
Make sure to call the UpdateShaderValues() method on the [Windshield Rain](/WindshieldRain) component after every parameter change.
